Cool stuff can be found here.\n\t * - types/   All the magic that is need to have observable objects, arrays and values is in this folder. Including the modifiers like `asFlat`.\n\t * - utils/   Utility stuff.\n\t *\n\t */\n\tvar extras = {\n\t    allowStateChanges: allowStateChanges,\n\t    deepEqual: deepEqual,\n\t    getAtom: getAtom,\n\t    getDebugName: getDebugName,\n\t    getDependencyTree: getDependencyTree,\n\t    getAdministration: getAdministration,\n\t    getGlobalState: getGlobalState,\n\t    getObserverTree: getObserverTree,\n\t    interceptReads: interceptReads,\n\t    isComputingDerivation: isComputingDerivation,\n\t    isSpyEnabled: isSpyEnabled,\n\t    onReactionError: onReactionError,\n\t    reserveArrayBuffer: reserveArrayBuffer,\n\t    resetGlobalState: resetGlobalState,\n\t    isolateGlobalState: isolateGlobalState,\n\t    shareGlobalState: shareGlobalState,\n\t    spyReport: spyReport,\n\t    spyReportEnd: spyReportEnd,\n\t    spyReportStart: spyReportStart,\n\t    setReactionScheduler: setReactionScheduler\n\t};\n\tvar everything = {\n\t    Reaction: Reaction,\n\t    untracked: untracked,\n\t    Atom: Atom, BaseAtom: BaseAtom,\n\t    useStrict: useStrict, isStrictModeEnabled: isStrictModeEnabled,\n\t    spy: spy,\n\t    comparer: comparer,\n\t    asReference: asReference, asFlat: asFlat, asStructure: asStructure, asMap: asMap,\n\t    isModifierDescriptor: isModifierDescriptor,\n\t    isObservableObject: isObservableObject,\n\t    isBoxedObservable: isObservableValue,\n\t    isObservableArray: isObservableArray,\n\t    ObservableMap: ObservableMap, isObservableMap: isObservableMap, map: map,\n\t    transaction: transaction,\n\t    observable: observable,\n\t    computed: computed,\n\t    isObservable: isObservable,\n\t    isComputed: isComputed,\n\t    extendObservable: extendObservable, extendShallowObservable: extendShallowObservable,\n\t    observe: observe,\n\t    intercept: intercept,\n\t    autorun: autorun, autorunAsync: autorunAsync, when: when, reaction: reaction,\n\t    action: action, isAction: isAction, runInAction: runInAction,\n\t    expr: expr,\n\t    toJS: toJS,\n\t    createTransformer: createTransformer,\n\t    whyRun: whyRun,\n\t    isArrayLike: isArrayLike,\n\t    extras: extras\n\t};\n\tvar warnedAboutDefaultExport = false;\n\tvar _loop_1 = function _loop_1(p) {\n\t    var val = everything[p];\n\t    Object.defineProperty(everything, p, {\n\t        get: function get() {\n\t            if (!warnedAboutDefaultExport) {\n\t                warnedAboutDefaultExport = true;\n\t                console.warn('Using default export (`import mobx from \\'mobx\\'`) is deprecated ' + 'and won’t work in mobx@4.0.0\\n' + 'Use `import * as mobx from \\'mobx\\'` instead');\n\t            }\n\t            return val;\n\t        }\n\t    });\n\t};\n\tfor (var p in everything) {\n\t    _loop_1(p);\n\t}\n\tif ((typeof __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ === 'undefined' ?
